Polkadot webwallet (which is also a node manager) :
https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/staking/actions

Misc remarks
------------
* you can't validate and nominate at the same time. If your node is a validator, and you chose to nominate, then the node is automatically removed from validators
* if you want to add own stake to your validator, go to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/staking/actions and click the "..." button at the right -> "bond more funds".
